Research software engineer at the University of Canterbury. I enjoy studing both research mathematics and topics in computer science. 
Feel free to check out [Github Profile](https://github.com/lispandfound). 

# My Interests
- Projective and Finite Geometry
- Algebra
- Category Theory (and, in particular, it's application to programming)
- Linear Algebra
- Functional Programming
- Type systems and theorem proving
- Algorithms and Data Structures (particularly combinatorial data structures)

# Showcase Projects
Some of these projects were university projects, but others are in my own passion pursuits. 

- [Exoplanet Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/lispandfound/exoplanet-deep-learning). University research project exploring the use of convolutional and reccurrent neural networks to discover transiting exoplanets.
- [Kamon Board Game](https://github.com/lispandfound/kamon-frontend). A playable version of the board game [Kamon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28738/kamon). Players can connect in rooms and play each other. This game is an abstract strategy game enclosing certain areas of a board (like Go), and route building.
  Comprised of canvas powered frontend and ocaml websocket backend. TBD may update this later with an AI to play.
- [Flatbot V2](https://github.com/lispandfound/flatbot-v2). A revamped telegram bot for making co-living situations more tolerable.
- [Barebones HTTP Server](https://github.com/lispandfound/barebones-http). A from-socket implementation of an HTTP/1.1 server to demonstrate network programming skills. Based on the codecrafters [HTTP Server Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server).
- [TexToSpeech](https://github.com/lispandfound/TexToSpeech). A utility for converting LaTeX to a plain-text approximation that is suitable for TTS programs to read. Useful for catching typos in LaTeX documents.

# Papers 
- [On the equivalence, stabilisers, and feet of Buekenhout-Tits unitals](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10623-023-01234-4.pdf). This paper addresses a number of open problems concerning Buekenhout-Tits unitals in $\mathrm{PG}(2, q^2)$, where $q = 2^{2e + 1}$ and $e \geq 1$.
